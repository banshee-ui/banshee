## Introduction

Banshee is a component library for Vue which seeks to only provide the JavaScript functionality and leaves the HTML markup and styling to you.  It ships with no CSS and minimal to no HTML in all components.

Banshee allows you to focus on building custom applications the way you want them to look without having to conform to another library's design specs.  Gain complete control on how you build Vue applications.

**NOTE: Banshee is under active development and should not be used in a production environment. Except API changes before Beta release.**

## Installation

_Beta coming soon._
