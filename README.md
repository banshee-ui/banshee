## Ideas / Future

- Add/Refactor to compound components... API is already getting a little cumbersome with all the options to pass to your components, we should just handle that for the user (ie aria stuff shouldn't be "opt-in" via v-bind="attrs", they shouldn't have to think about it)
- Start writing unit tests you idiot..
- Add comments
